# OT Lakehouse – Fabric-Ready Architecture

This project demonstrates an end-to-end operational technology (OT) data platform
designed using lakehouse and medallion architecture principles.

The solution mirrors Microsoft Fabric capabilities, including:
- Data ingestion and orchestration
- Lakehouse (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- Analytics-ready warehouse tables
- Semantic modeling for Power BI

The platform is built using Apache Spark (Databricks Community Edition)
to ensure direct portability to Microsoft Fabric.
